# React Native Uninitialized State Variable Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized. This often happens with asynchronous operations (like API calls) or complex state updates.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The component attempts to render the `data` from state before the asynchronous `useEffect` hook has had a chance to update the state. This leads to an error, usually a `TypeError` or `undefined` error.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It uses the `isLoading` state variable to indicate whether the data is still loading.  This prevents rendering before the data is available.  Conditional rendering ensures that content only appears once the data has been fetched successfully.
